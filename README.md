## <p> Day 2: Spatial statistics and spatial econometrics: an introduction</br></p>

### Lecture 1:  
- Spatial data: basic features and analysis tools (stationarity, semivariogram)  
- Spatial structure (definition of neighbors)  
- Spatial dependency and corresponding tests  
- Spatial clusters  
- Simple predictions based on spatial data (spatial interpolation, krigging)  

### Lecture 2:
- Spatial econometric models for cross-sectional (CS) data   
- Estimation and interpretation of selected spatial CS model types   
- Robustness of the estimated models with respect to changing spatial structure   
- Spatial econometrics using panel data (brief introduction)   

### Seminars 4 and 5  
- Seminars follow the topics of Lectures 1 and 2  
- Seminars are based on R/RStudio  
- `{spdep}` and `{splm}` packages are used.
