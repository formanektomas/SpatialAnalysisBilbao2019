This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you *click* the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can hide the `summary(cars)` R code from the knitted output:
(this is done using the `echo=FALSE` parameter)  
Note: two empty spaces at the end of a line force a line return

* Lists are insterted using `*`
* Horizontal lines `---`
* Headings are produced using `#`, `##`, etc. 
* Math expression are inserted through `LaTex` syntax: $\hat{\beta}_1$, $\sigma_i^2$

#### Another `R` code \& output goes here:


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

Additional information on the data:
```{r, echo=T}
str(cars)
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=T}
plot(cars)
```

Alternatively, you can hide the plot command `plot(cars)` using `echo=FALSE`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
